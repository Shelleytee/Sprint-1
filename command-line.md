What is command line?
- It is a tool used to type command directly to the computers operating system. It's like bypassing the consciousness to talk directly to the subconscious.

Commands I've learned today
- pwd - display my current directory path
- ls - display current directory contents
- mkdir - make a new directory
- cd - change my current directory to somewhere else
- touch - create a new file
- exit - end or close the terminal/command line
- man - shows definition of command meaning and syntax, and descriptors
- wildcard * - any letter or character appearing from this point
- move - move a file or folder from one location to another
- mv - move files or rename them
